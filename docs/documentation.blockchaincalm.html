<h2>Welcome</h2>
Welcome to blockchain calm, a web app to interact with blockchains
<p>

<h2>Get Started</h2>

Start with something simple. A network with 3 or 4 nodes should be enough to show how a blockchain works.
<p>
<img style='display:block;margin:20px;'src='documentation.graph.4.peers.png' />
<p>
Later on you can try to add more peers as well as deleting others.
The tool lets you choose the maximum number of collections allowed for every peer. So, with a bit of practice,
you will be able to build any topology you wish for your peer network. 
<p>
When you publish a block (e.g.: Alice sends 100 to Bob) keep an eye on the screen to see how transactions get added in a blockchain 
and how the chain is propagated through the network 



<h2>The Peer Network</h2>

<ul>
<li>A peer <img src='documentation.peer.43x43.png' /> represents a machine running the software that maintains the ever growing list of records (the blockchain)</li>
<li>Each peer has a unique identifier (3 letter in our case) just like any computer on the Internet has an IP Address</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer connections are shown through lines (edges of the graph)</li>
<li>You can choose the maximum number of connections for any given peer <code title='On a BitCoin client you might have around 200 connections'>(2,3,5,8)</code></li>
<li>You can terminate a peer at any time</li>
<li>You can create a new peer at any time</li>
<li>Nodes connect to other nodes randomly</li>
<li>You can see the blockchain of any peer at any time</li>
<li>The number in brackets on a peer tells you the length of its blockchain e.g.:<code>QXS(4)</code></li> 
</ul>


<h2>Publishing a record</h2>


<ul>
<li>You hit the <img src='send.64x64.png' /> broadcast to publish a random transaction (e.g Joe sends Alice 200) to a random peer.</li>
<li>For sake of simplicity, a block contains one transaction only*</li> <!-- *A simplification for sake of clarity In a real blockchain a block might be made up of an array of transactions. -->
<li>First hit always sends the genesis block (in our case Joe receives 1000)</li>
<li>You can send several transactions in one go (by hitting the button repeatedly) and observe different scenarios:
<ul>
<li>Transaction might be rejected because the sender has not enough available money.</li>
<li>Peers might build different chains and the consensus algorithm will dictate which chain lasts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>The blockchain</h2>

<ul>
<li>Every peer maintains its list of blocks: the blockchain</li>
<li>The ledger is derived by traversing the blockchain.</li>
<li>A transaction is made like this <code>{ sender: 'Joe', inputIndexes: [3,7], amount:100, receiver: { Alice:60,Joe:40 } }</code></li>
<li>The array of input-indexes refer to indexes in the blockchain to prove the availability of unspent transactions</li>
<li>If Joe wants to send Alice 60 and he is referring to unspent transactions for a total of 100 he needs to also send himself 40</li>
<li>Transactions might be rejected due to lack of money from the sender (if you are lucky you might witness the double-spending problem in action)</li>
</ul>
